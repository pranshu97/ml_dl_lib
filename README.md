# ml_dl_lib
A library with implementations for machine learning algorithms and deep learning layers.

### How to run
Clone the repo </br>
Run dl_example.py with: `python3 dl_example.py`

OR

import into your notebook and play with it like </br>
``` python
from dl_layers import ConvLayer, PoolLayer, GlobalAveragePoolLayer, DropoutLayer, LinearLayer
from ml_models import KMeans, KNN
```


Note: For learning purposes only. Backpropagation is not implemented for the deep learning modules.
